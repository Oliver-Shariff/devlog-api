# DevLog API

**DevLog API** is a backend service designed to evolve into a complete journaling and data management platform.
Built with FastAPI and PostgreSQL, it provides a secure and scalable foundation for user authentication, content creation, and personal data analytics.

The goal of DevLog is to showcase development of a production-ready backend starting from a simple REST API and progressively expanding into a fully featured system with authentication, validation, file storage, and Docker-based deployment.

The final system will enable authenticated users to:
- Create and manage personal journal entries (or “logs”)
- Attach files and media
- Retrieve analytics such as entries per day or tag distribution
- Interact with a fully documented, containerized, and cloud-ready backend
